# Tasque
## An easy to use framework for background tasks in Ruby

Tasque is designed to be flexible, scalable, and do as little as possible. It's multi threaded, and allows developers to easily leverage all available system resources. Anyone can create input adapters for Tasque to receive messages for processing.

## Getting Started

1. Install Tasque at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        gem install tasque

2. At the command prompt, create a new Tasque:

        tasque new mytask

   where "mytask" is the application name.

## Requirements

Compatible with JRuby (1.7) and Ruby (2.0) others might work fine.
